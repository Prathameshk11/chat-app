## **Known Issues**
### **Welcome Page User Behavior**
On the welcome page, users are expected to input a **username** and **password**, then click "Sign Up" to register. However:
- Users often expect the "Sign Up" button to redirect them to a dedicated sign-up page instead of registering directly.  
This is a UI issue caused by the static HTML structure and needs improvement to provide better user flow.
